# DeterminantsofthePricePaidatAuction
In this paper I look at the determinants of the price paid at auction for sales of contemporary art by twelve artists, modelling each separately. My work re-contextualises earlier work and also looks at one determinant, the type of title the work was presented with, which has received very limited attention from other scholars.
